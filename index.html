        <section id="approach">
            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>We believe that access to quality education and resources should not be limited by location or financial circumstance. Afiaprime Lab offers a unique, inclusive approach to learning that focuses on the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessible Education:</strong> We provide free and subsidized training programs designed for beginners, ensuring that anyone, regardless of their background, can embark on a tech career. Our curriculum is hands-on and designed to give learners practical experience that prepares them for real-world challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Support for Innovation:</strong> We understand that talent is not limited to the classroom. That’s why we offer resources such as laptops, mentorship, and seed funding to help highly innovative learners turn their ideas into viable tech products. We aim to bridge the gap between education and entrepreneurship by helping these young minds launch their own projects and businesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Readiness and Opportunities:</strong> Our connections with tech industry leaders and employers allow us to link learners with job opportunities, internships, and freelance work. We provide career guidance and practical experience through collaborations with tech companies and startups, enabling learners to gain hands-on experience that makes them job-ready.</li>
                <li><strong>Community and Collaboration:</strong> We foster a vibrant, supportive community where learners can collaborate, network, and share knowledge. We believe in the power of mentorship, peer learning, and collaboration to drive innovation and success.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We are committed to ensuring the long-term success of our programs by maintaining a sustainable model supported by donations, partnerships, and collaborations. We accept all forms of donations, including funding, technology, and mentorship, to help support the continued growth of Afiaprime Lab and its learners.</li>
